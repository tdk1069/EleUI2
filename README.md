The best way to Fresh install this is to :

2. Restart Mudlet if you already have it loaded
3. Start a new profile and select Offline
4. Drag the package you downloaded into ele 
5. Connect to ele
6. type 'ui config' to choose and move which elements you want shown around.

To Upgrade:
**note** As of v1.53, *ui update* will check here for updates, download and install if available (If you have made any code tweaks they will get lost so backup!) 
Older than v1.53:
1. Load your profile offline.
2. Uninstall EleUI2 via the package manager
3. Install the new release via the package manager
4. connect!

Default Predefined Alias's 
**ui config** - This shows the config window where you can select which elements are visible

First release. Expect bugs :) i've done my best to get something usable together.

It's probably a good idea to untick "info" in the map window, and set the room/line/zoom to scales you like.

This UI uses AnimatedTimers,Drag and Drop framework, ECMO tab's for chat.
